/**
@brief Base class for path planners

CONTRACT:
    INPUT : A list of cones to be used for planning at that instance
    OUTPUT : A path
        ---- Find a good data structure for them ----
    BEHAVIOUR : ....

USAGE:
    set_cones() -> plan() -> get_best_path()/other getters

ANALYSIS:
    Compromise the computer vision section
        Missing cones
        Incorrect color

    Loss function : based on compromisation of vision 
        Color
        Cone lining up in a reasonable curve
        Path is of reasonable curve
        Distance between consecutive cones
        Have cones on both side

TO RESEARCH:
    How to refine the path certainty other time
    Metrics for performance evaluation
    The path planner takes input from SLAM, but still stores meaningful
        data itself regarding past path

TO EXPLORE:
    Efficient Data Handling: Ensure your path planner can efficiently process incoming data in real-time. This might involve optimizing data structures for faster access and updates.
        Data Structure & Algorithm: the CGAL lib may have high overhead since it's optimised for large set of poitns not repeated calculation with new set of points every time stamp
        Caching and Reuse: Cache previously calculated paths or path segments that are likely to be reused. When a similar planning scenario occurs, you can quickly retrieve and adapt these paths instead of starting from scratch.
            Matching Algorithm: Implement an algorithm to match the current cones' positions with the translated positions from the previous cycle. This can be done using nearest neighbor matching, where each cone in the current cycle is matched with the closest translated cone from the previous cycle.
                Thresholding: Set a maximum expected deviation from the average or median value. If a reading exceeds this threshold, it's considered an outlier and rejected.
                Running Average: Maintain a running average of the sensor readings. If a new reading is significantly different from this average, it can be discarded or given less weight.
                Median Filter: Use a median filter, which replaces each entry with the median of neighboring entries. This method is effective in removing "spike" noise.
        Parallel Data Processing: Utilize parallel computing techniques to process data concurrently, leveraging multi-core processors.
        Profile and Benchmark: Regularly profile the data handling process to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.

    Continuous Updating Mechanism: Your algorithm should be able to update its path planning based on new data without restarting from scratch. This could be achieved through incremental updates to the existing path or quick re-planning.
        Incremental Updates: Implement the ability to modify the existing path based on new data. For instance, if a new obstacle is detected, only the path segments affected by this obstacle should be recalculated.
        Maintaining a Balance: Strive for a balance between adapting to new data and sticking to the original plan. Constantly changing the path can lead to inefficiency and erratic behavior.
        Feedback Loops (Adaptive): Incorporate feedback mechanisms to continuously assess the validity of the path and make adjustments as needed
    
    Predictive Analysis: Use predictive models to anticipate future changes in the environment and adjust the path accordingly.
    
    Concurrency and Threading: Consider using multi-threading or asynchronous programming to handle data processing, path computation, and execution in parallel.

NOTE:
    The path always stems from the car body

EXPERIMENTAL INSIGHTS:
    The path with the highest number of Point_2 is not always the correct path (esp. in the case of missing cones) 
    The path that 'unlocks' the most cones is not alwasy the correct path (esp. in the case of missing cones)
